          <p class="history">
            Mike Patey was born in Gresham, Oregon, along with twin brother,
            Mark, right in the middle of 11 children. He and his wife, Chandra,
            who is a pilot as well, have 4 children. His aviation journey began
            in a 1971 Cessna 172L in 2002. He subsequently earned his
            single/multi-engine land and sea, commercial, instrument, and
            rotorcraft ratings along with various endorsements. His natural
            energy and knack for engineering feed his love for the challenge to
            circumvent the norms and “build it better.” This drives his passion
            to create and build his own airplanes, which he uses for competitive
            racing, STOL, flying his family, business, and playing with his
            fellow “Flying Cowboys.” He holds several aviation records and
            enthusiastically shares his process and adventures via his YouTube
            channel.
